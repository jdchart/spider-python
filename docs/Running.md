# Running
To run on your machine I advise creating a virtual envrionment. While running the environment, `cd` to the `spider` folder and `pip install .`.

## Changes in development
During development, `cd` to `spider` and run `pip install .` each time a change is made to the code base.

## Running tests
To run all of the test scripts:

```
python -m unittest discover "/Path/to/spider-python/Tests"
```

You can also run them seperately (see the [Tests](/Tests/) folder).
